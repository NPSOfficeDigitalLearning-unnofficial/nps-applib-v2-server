# TypeScript w/ Jest Template

TypeScript project with Jest and ESLint pre-configured.

I had to make this for another project of mine and it
was a bit of a pain, so I made it public so that pain
can be experienced less.

## Using the Template

Use GitHub to copy the template repo, then go into
`package.json` to set your project name and
description. If your coding style is different than
mine (it probably is, I'm weird), consider modifying
`.eslintrc.json`. I used the unliscense, so there
should not be any copyright issues, but I would
appreciate it if you credit me.
